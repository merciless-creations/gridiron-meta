     ## GitHub Issue Management

     When creating issues for this multi-repo project, always:

     1. **Assign issues to the correct GitHub Project:**
        - Parent/epic issues → Project 4 (Goal To Go Football): https://github.com/orgs/merciless-creations/projects/4
        - gridiron (API) issues → Project 1 (Gridiron Roadmap): https://github.com/orgs/merciless-creations/projects/1
        - gridiron-web issues → Project 3 (Web Roadmap): https://github.com/orgs/merciless-creations/projects/3
        - gridiron-engine issues → Project 2 (Engine Roadmap): https://github.com/orgs/merciless-creations/projects/2

     2. **Link sub-issues to parent issues** using GitHub's sub-issue feature

     3. **Repository mapping:**
        - gridiron = C# .NET API backend
        - gridiron-web = React/TypeScript frontend
        - gridiron-engine = Game simulation engine
