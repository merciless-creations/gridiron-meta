# Statistical Targets

Target distributions derived from NFL data 2020-2024. These are the **goals** for simulation output — what the engine should produce when aggregated across 1000+ games with normally-distributed player abilities.

**Acceptable variance:** ±5% on primary metrics.

**Validation:** Use `Gridiron.Validator` project to validate simulation output against these targets.

## Rushing

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Yards per carry (league avg) | 4.3 | RBs specifically ~4.3, QBs higher (~5.5 for mobile QBs) |
| Negative plays | ~15% | Runs for loss or no gain |
| 10+ yard runs | ~12% | Explosive plays |
| 20+ yard runs | ~3% | Big plays |
| Fumble rate (per carry) | ~0.8% | ~44% of fumbles are lost |

### Rushing Yard Distribution

```
-3 to -1: 8%
0: 7%
1-2: 20%
3-4: 25%
5-6: 18%
7-9: 12%
10-14: 6%
15-19: 2.5%
20+: 1.5%
```

Use a right-skewed distribution (e.g., shifted exponential or gamma) with mode ~3.

| Sack rate | 6.0-7.0% | Per dropback |
| TD rate | 4.5-5.0% | Per pass attempt |

### Completion by Depth

| Depth | Completion % | Avg YAC |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Behind LOS | 78-82% | 5-7 |
| Short (1-10) | 68-72% | 4-5 |
| Medium (11-20) | 52-58% | 3-4 |
| Deep (21+) | 38-45% | 2-3 |

### Air Yards Distribution

When a pass is attempted, target depth distribution:
```
Behind LOS (screens): 12%
Short (1-10): 48%
Medium (11-20): 28%
Deep (21+): 12%
```

## Turnovers

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Turnovers per game (team) | 1.2-1.4 | Trending downward over time |
| Interceptions per game | 0.7-0.9 | |
| Fumbles lost per game | 0.5-0.6 | |
| Fumble recovery rate | 44% | Offense recovers 56% |

### Turnover Context Modifiers

Increase probability when:
- Player is fatigued (stamina < 60%)
- Player discipline is low
- Pressure on QB (rush vs. protection mismatch)
- Ball carrier hit by multiple defenders

Decrease probability when:
- Player has high ball security attribute
- Short, safe passes
- Handoffs to RBs with high discipline

### Penalty Type Distribution

| Penalty | % of Total | Typical Yards |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| Offensive holding | 22% | 10 |
| False start | 14% | 5 |
| Defensive pass interference | 10% | Spot |
| Defensive holding | 8% | 5 + auto 1st |
| Defensive offside | 8% | 5 |
| Unnecessary roughness | 6% | 15 |
| Illegal contact | 4% | 5 + auto 1st |
| Delay of game | 4% | 5 |
| Other | 24% | Varies |

## Validation

Use the `Gridiron.Validator` project to run large-scale simulations:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Gridiron.Validator -- --games 1000 --seed 42
```

### How to Use This Document

1. **During development** — Reference targets when tuning probabilities in `GameProbabilities.cs`
2. **After changes** — Run validation to ensure statistics remain realistic
3. **Debugging** — If a metric is off, trace back to the relevant SkillsCheck class
